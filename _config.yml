          Purpose : We quantified how healthy the community is, and presented it along with the price data of 
          a specific project so that the data acts as a major factor in users' investment. In addition, the {on, off}
           Chain data of the Crypto project was visually shown to help intuitive understanding. UX improvement
            was promoted by using a chatbot so that it could be viewed momentarily in the messenger.
             This project is implemented in Python and Dune Analytics.
