          Proposed Solution: YOLY(You Only Look at Yourself) is a real-time visual and haptic guidance system for golf swing in virtual reality. 
          Users can correct their posture according to the first-person and third-person perspectives displayed on the virtual screen seen through the Head-Mounted Display (HMD). 
          The virtual screen corresponds with the user's head movements, mitigating the "look-aways" phenomenon. 
          Additionally, in accordance with related research, we divided the training sessions into a practice phase and a full-swing phase. 
          The practice phase comprises seven stages: address, back-swing, top-of-swing, down-swing, impact, follow-through, and finish. 
          We selected four steps before impact. Each phase gives the user visual guidance and haptic feedback in real-time.

          Abstract: ZooBlox is an innovative project that integrates smart block toys with a tablet application powered by generative AI, 
          aiming to revolutionize the way children engage with toys and technology. 
          The project focuses on enhancing children’s creativity by enabling them to construct imaginary animals using physical blocks and digital technology. 
          In this application, generative AI plays a pivotal role in transforming these creations into virtual beings within a digital zoo, encouraging imagination, 
          confidence, and technological familiarity in children. 
          This innovative approach, merging physical play with AI technology, promotes creativity and prepares children for future technological landscapes.

           Chain data of the Crypto project was visually shown to help intuitive understanding. UX improvement
            was promoted by using a chatbot so that it could be viewed momentarily in the messenger.
             This project is implemented in Python and Dune Analytics.
